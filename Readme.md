## JARVIS Voice Assistant

Welcome to the JARVIS Voice Assistant project! This project brings to life a virtual assistant inspired by the iconic J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Iron Man universe. The assistant is designed to make daily tasks easier by responding to voice commands, providing information, and performing various automated actions.

### Features

- Speech Recognition: Interprets and processes your voice commands.  
- Text-to-Speech: Provides natural-sounding verbal responses.  
- Task Automation: Executes tasks such as sending emails, setting alarms, opening applications, and managing files.  
- Internet Queries: Fetches answers to questions, news updates, weather forecasts, and more.  
- Custom Commands: Allows users to create and add personalized commands for specific tasks.  
- Multilingual Support: Offers responses in multiple languages (optional and configurable).  
- Expandable Design: Modular architecture makes it easy to add new functionalities.  

### Installation

1. Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.  
2. Required libraries and dependencies.  

### Usage

- Launch the assistant and speak into your microphone.  
- Use natural language commands such as:  
1. "Whatâ€™s the weather today?"  
2. "Set an alarm for 7 AM."  
3. "Open Spotify."  
4. "Send an email to John."  

### Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute:  
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.

### Future Plans

1. Enhance natural language processing for better command understanding.  
2. Add integration with smart home devices (IoT).  
3. Develop a mobile app version of the assistant.  
4. Implement machine learning for predictive task suggestions.
